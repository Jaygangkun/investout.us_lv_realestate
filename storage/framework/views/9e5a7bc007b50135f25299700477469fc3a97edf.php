                            <div class="inside-text" style="color:white;"> <br>The Invest Out model represents a fundamental shift in the way the residential real estate industry treats homeowners because we’ve changed the orientation of the industry. Within the Invest Out model we’ve adjusted the orientation of the deal from prioritizing the needs of the investors, banks and wholesalers to refocusing the model towards the homeowners and investors, the true entities actually adding value to the deal. When you change the orientation of the model, new opportunities present themselves, ones that allow homeowners to make considerably more money; a new model that allows investors an opportunity to grow their businesses faster, requires less money for the flip and makes it considerably easier to find the homes. This is why you need to take the Invest Out course. Our course is also accompanied by a companion guide that allows the trainee a chance to further refine their skills through exercises and additional content. With this course you will be prepared to engage homeowners, present proposals for the renovation of their homes and grow your business faster than you had ever thought possible.</div>

                                            <li class="answer"> The training is designed for anyone who’s interested in fix and flip investing but has limited cash available for investing. With the Invest Out model less cash is required because the home is never purchased by the investor. This means all of the cash that would normally go to banks, stays with the homeowner and investors depending on how the deal is structured.</li>
                                            <li class="answer">There are a lot of ways a deal can be structured. The Invest Out course will teach you about the options for determining the current value of the home and calculating the distribution of the profits between the homeowners and investors.</li>

                                            <p class="answer"> Partner Up is designed for everyone who’s connected to the property being offered: Property owners, investors, Realtors®. The benefits extend across all of the parties involved in the deal. The homeowner can get top dollar for their home, investors can avoid the short term ownership of the home while Realtors® can make considerably more from the increased value of the home.</p>

                                            <p class="answer">Investors have been partnering with homeowners since the 1980 and the PBS This Old House home renovation show. The challenge however is that while investors routinely Fix and Flip, very few seek out Partnering opportunities as an investment strategy.   </p>

                                            <p class="answer"> The course will teach you this. Invest Out believes the best way to show the value of an investment is by using the same KPIs that are used on all other investment types. As a student of Invest Out you will also receive the deal analyzer which is an easy to use Excel Spreadsheet based dashboard designed present the Return on Investment as well as the Risk Reward ratio to compare the options of a Fix and Flip to a Partner Up investment. </p>

                                            <p class="answer"> Within the Invest Out business model, representatives of invest out partner with the sellers and investors in support of achieving a successful renovation. We facilitate the inspection of the property, the signing of all documents, we secure the property for the investor's protection and show up at the closing to perform the transfer of the property from the seller to the buyer. This means that the capital investment and profits due to the investor will be transferred from the buyer directly to the investor at that time of closing. </p>

                                            <p class="answer"> The homeowner/ property seller will be the person who selects from the submitted proposals, the designs that best align with their view of what the renovation should entail. Some proposals will be more limited and very simple while others may be more detailed, comprehensive and involve multiple steps and changes. Those types of renovations will also be more costly but should also produce a more significant return on the investment. The sellers don't develop the renovation plan; the investors will do that. The seller simply picks the vision of the investor that best aligns with what they believe is possible with the property. Once the investor is selected, and the work is performed, that's it. As long as the work performed is in line the proposed plan, the investor has satisfied their obligation. This is also how the seller knows that the property will be renovated to create the maximum value because the seller signed off on the renovation.</p>

                                            <p class="faq-question">7. As a homeowner can I use a realtor to sell my home?</p>
                                            <p class="answer"> As a seller, we suggest that you use a realtor to assist in selling the home especially considering the speed at which the sale occurs directly affects you as the seller but even more so, the investor. According to the National Association of REALTORS®, in a 2014 report (2014 Profile of Home Buyers and Sellers, National Association of REALTORS®), "For Sale By Owners typically have a lower median selling price: $208,700 compared to $235,000. Thus the average agent-assisted home sale typically has a 13% higher sales price than the typical FSBO sale".  When you combine this increase in median sale price with the additional profits that can be achieved through an Invest Out renovation, we believe that it's in both of your interest to engage a realtor in the sale. If the challenge is with the commission that would have to be paid to the realtor(s), discuss with the investor and try to negotiate a division of the profits that consider the commissions, one to which both of you can agree.</p>

                                            <li class="answer"> Ensuring that your investment is protected is one of the most important things you need to know about any investment you do. Within the course we walk through the contracts that secure the deal but we also speak to the remedies that can be taken to further ensure you’re made whole following a Partnership. Invest Out recommends qualifying inspections at different stages of the renovation to ensure that the repairs are quality and in line with code. </li>
